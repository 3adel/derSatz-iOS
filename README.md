# derSatz-iOS
der Satz is a German language text analyser based on iOS NLP APIs. It dissects German articles into sentences, translates them and color-codes the words based on their part of speech. It's ideal for language learners in their beginner or intermediate German language levels. A friend and I created this app based on a personal need to help us learn German.
